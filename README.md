## Ground Rules for this project:

* Use your own branch, **DO NOT** push to master
    * to do this you can:
        * `git checkout -b <your_branch>`
* Commit at the **end of every day** and after any major changes
    * to do this, when on your branch **only**:
        * `git add *`
        * `git commit -m <message>`
        * `git push`
    * Aditionally most major text editors and IDEs will have GitHub integration through a GUI
* All commit messages should be useful and meaningful
    * For example:
        * `Added <x>`
        * `Removed <x>`
* When you want something pulled to the master branch open a pull request
    * the easiest way to do this is online by hitting pull up above ^
    * from here any changes can be checked and verified before they are merged
* Communication will be handled via Discord and GitHub, no other online means.
    * Whilst face to face meetings are enforced by the brief there are no rules for online communication however:
        * No posting of code or sending of code via any platform aside from GitHub
